# Nobsidion

Nobsidion is an Obsidian plugin designed to sync your Obsidian vault with your Notion workspace. Building upon the [Obsidian to Notion](https://github.com/EasyChris/obsidian-to-notion/) plugin, Nobsidion offers additional functionality and refinements, making the syncing process more seamless and integrated.

⚠️ This Obsidian plugin is not yet rigorously tested (I'm actively working on this) so it is not ready for production usage.

## Vision

-   **Bi-directional Sync**: Keep your Obsidian notes and Notion pages in sync with changes reflected in both platforms.
-   **Customizable Sync**: Choose which parts of your vault you want to sync with Notion. Current note, entire vault, or all notes linked with the current note.
-   **Link Conversion**: Convert Obsidian-style links (`[[Link]]`) into Notion's internal page mentions.

## Deliverables

-   [x] Upload current note or the entire vault with tags and banner. Thanks to [EasyChris](https://github.com/EasyChris) and [@jannikbuscha](https://github.com/jannikbuscha)
-   [x] Support for multiple languages. Thanks to [EasyChris](https://github.com/EasyChris)
-   [x] Mobile support. Thanks to [EasyChris](https://github.com/EasyChris)
-   [x] Transfer Obsidian wiki-links into hyperlinks so Notion can parse.
-   [ ] Transfer Obsidian wiki-links into Notion's internal page mentions.
