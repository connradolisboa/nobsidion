# Nobsidion

A fork from [Obsidian to Notion](https://github.com/EasyChris/obsidian-to-notion/). Special thanks to EasyChris.

While [Obsidian to Notion](https://github.com/EasyChris/obsidian-to-notion/) only supports upload one note to Notion, this plugin also enables bulk upload, and notes that are linked to the current notes. All the page hyperlinks are formatted into Notion internal page mentions.

It is work in progress. Expect more documentation to come.
